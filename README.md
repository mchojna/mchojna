## About me:
I am a third-year Management and Artificial Intelligence student and a first-year Computer Science student.

After successfully completing an internship as Data Engineer, I am currently working as a Junior Process Intelligence Analyst, where I leverage my data analysis, programming, automating, and machine learning skills to draw insights from large volumes of data related to Consumer Health and IT Quality processes. By doing this I contribute to informed business decisions and assist in developing apps, dashboards, and solutions, while also developing my skill, expanding my knowledge, and gaining real-life experience.¬†

Looking ahead, I plan to specialize in machine learning and deep learning, with a keen interest in applying these techniques in the automotive industry or gaming industry. By doing this I want to contribute to cutting-edge developments and make a meaningful impact in these domains.
